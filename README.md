# GrowHome Webapp Prototype 

For California-based startup GrowHome, I helped develop an initial concept and backend using Django, documented the technical aspects of the web-app, as well as outlined responsibilities for a front end engineer under this concept. The app was built using function-based views, and used Django's template functionality to serve interactive webpages. (In other words, it was not a REST API.) 

## Status

The project was not completed after the technical team disbanded and a whitelabel solution was selected. 

## Purpose
This project presents a possible solution to the problem the organization was trying to fix: eliminating the disconnect between entrepreneurs in the Middle East and professionals in the diaspora who wanted to participate in projects happening back home. The GrowHome website was meant to be a solution that enabled collaboration, fundraising, and networking for its intended users. 

## Technical Considerations

As there were many different specific requirements for this platform, I was required to specially configure certain imported packages in order for them to execute certain functions. All information on such peculiarities are presented in the documentation.
